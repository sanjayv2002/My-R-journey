## Introduction
In this report we test for a relationship between different parts of morphology in _Iris_ flowers


## Materials $ methods
Analyses are based on data for three _Iris_ species from the work of [R.A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher). We used linear regression to test for relationships.

## Results

```{r}
plot(x = iris$Petal.Length,
     y = iris$Petal.Width,
     xlab = "Petal length (cm)",
     ylab = "Petal width (cm)")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
    iris.model <- lm(Petal.Width ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)
    iris.model.summary <- summary(iris.model)
    r.squared <- iris.model.summary$r.squared
```
    
    Petal width and petal length were highly correlated (r^2^ = `r round(r.squared, 2)`).
