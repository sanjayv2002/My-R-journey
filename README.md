# My-R-journey
This repository contains code for various R projects and tutorials that I have completed as part of my learning journey. The topics covered include:

- Your first plot in R
- Stats in R: lightning intro
- A primer for multivariate analyses in R
- Next level visualization with ggplot
- Reproducible reports with knitr
- Heatmaps in R (with data wrangling!)
- Write your own functions
- Cluster plots and heatmaps combined
- Heatmaps: the gene expression version
- A very brief intro to species distribution models
- Easier data manipulation and visualization with tidyverse
- An introduction to summarizing and visualizing data for R novices
- Feel free to explore the code and use it as a resource for your own learning.
